Title: Hidden Markov Random Field for Spatial Transcriptomic Data
Version: 0.1
Author: Qian Zhu and Guo-Cheng Yuan
Description: Discovery of spatial patterns with Hidden Markov Random Field. This package is designed for spatial transcriptomic data and single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) data such as sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization (seqFISH) and multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH). The methods implemented in this package are described in Zhu et al. (2018) <doi:10.1038/nbt.4260>.
